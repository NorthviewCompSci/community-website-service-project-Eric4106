                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>Each team races to buzz in to each toss-up question read off by the reader.
                    <br>The person who buzzes is the only one allowed to respond to the toss-up.</p>
                <p>If they answer incorrectly, the oposing team is allowed to listen to the question fully then
                    <br>one member of their team responds. If they get it wrong, the reader then skips the coresponding
                    <br>bonus question and moves on to the next toss-up.</p>
                <p>If either team answers the question correctly, they get 5 points and are the only team
                    <br>who can answer the next bonus questions.</p>
                <p>If either team interupts the reader and then answers wrong, they lose 5 points.
                    <br>If they answered correctly they gain 5 points. Waiting for the reader to finnish will
                    <br>always ensure that you do not lose points regardless of your answer.</p>
                <p>Bonus questions are quesitons that correspond to each toss-up question and can be gained by wining
                    <br>the respective tossup. Bonus questions are usually divided into three parts each about the topic.<br>Unlike the toss-up, your team is allowed to communicate with eachother during the bonus question.</p>
                <p>One other way to gain points durring a toss-up is by answering with what we call 'power'. Power is a
                    <br>section of bolded text at the begining of the toss-up. The toss-ups are designed to start vauge <br>and become easier as they give more information further into the question. Answering wrong will <br>still lose you 5 point, but answering correctly with Power will gain you 15 point...
                    <br><br>As well as bragging rights.</p>
