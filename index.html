                <h2>What is QuizBowl?</h2>
                <p>NAQT defines QuizBowl as "a fast-paced buzzer competition in which teams of four players compete to answer questions". Though this is a good overview, in lamen's terms, QuizBowl is like Jeopardy without the question format. In QuizBowl one reader reads off of a question packet a toss-up question. In the toss-up rounds anyone can answer, but only any one member can buzz because after one team buzzes and gets it wrong, the other team gets a try. QuizBowl is a game of quick fingers, fast brains, and every now and again, some random luck.</p>
                <p>Toss-up questions are fast-paced and everyman for himself, however bonus questions are the oposite. After answering a toss-up correctly, your team gets a three part bonus question where the team can work together, formulate an answer, then give their agreed upon answer to the reader.</p>
                <p>There are many diferent styles of playing the game, however our Quizbowl team follows the rules laid out by NAQT. NAQT, or the National Academic Quiz Tournaments, is the organization that creates questions for matches and organized various events across the country.</p>
